 * Render wiring for the Catalog — the `name → Component` map spread into the MDX
 * render so every Component is available globally, without an `import` in the
 * Aula. The Catalog's *definitions* (names, when-to-use, props) are the single
 * source of truth in `src/catalog.ts`; a test keeps this map's keys in lockstep
 * with them, so a Component can never be renderable but undocumented (or vice
 * versa).
